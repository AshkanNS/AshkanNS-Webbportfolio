I have created my first webbportfolio by using HTML, CSS and Javascript
The portfolio is structured to present information about me, my experience, the projects I have worked on, and references regarding my ongoing education and work.

I started by structuring my project by creating and preparing each and every folder and file, to after start with the coding that was neccessary.
Using the external CSS helped me keep things more clear and understandable where i could work side by side with my Index.html for a more accurate layout and designs.
also added the google fonts for some logos that ive used here in this project.

Some more details of my work:
- Responsive web design compatible
- Navigation bar for easy access to different sections of the portfolio
- Interactive banners to highlight key skills
- Direct links to detailed projects on GitHub
- Contact form for inquiries

- Book Review Platform: A platform where users can review books and share opinions.
- GDP Capita Project: An analytical tool that visualizes GDP per capita data across different countries.

Thank you for visiting my portfolio!
